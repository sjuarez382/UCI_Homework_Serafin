* Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.
  * *The mean summarizes the successful more meaningfully due to the fact that the range of MIN and MAX spans from 0 - 26,457, it makes more sense for the median to be used in the unsuccessful data as the range is smaller.
* Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
  * *There is more variability with the successful campaigns, this makes sense due to the large number of backers and the count of campaigns.
